# SEI Daily Code Challenges

## Intro

During your 12 weeks in SEI, your instructors will be helping you learn tons of coding knowledge and skills using a proven approach where each lesson typically includes a mixture of:

- Instructor lecture & demonstration
- Instructor/student code alongs
- In-lesson student exercises
- Lab time

However, true learning doesn't take place until students practice what they've been taught. In fact, it's not uncommon for students to take 7 to 10 days of applying a particular concept before they are truly "comfortable" with it.

To provide practice in class, many lessons are followed with post-lesson labs. And of course, there's project week, where students often feel they learn the most.

To provide additional practice writing JavaScript functions to solve a specific task, you will be required to complete one code challenge per day during weeks: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 & 8. Totaling 30 challenges.

These code challenges are considered deliverables, and thus 80% of them must be completed in combination with other deliverable homework/assignments in order to receive a Certificate of Completion.

You may choose to do more than one per day, or none at all - just don't fall too far behind!

## Set Up

1. Fork this repo into your GHE account by clicking the **[Fork]** button in the top-right of the page.

2. Since you cannot have nested repos, be sure to move outside of the class, or any other repo before the next step.

3. To bring the materials in the repo into your computer, clone *your fork* of the repo by copying the URL shown when you click the **[Clone or download]**: `$ git clone <the copied URL>`

4. Slack your instructors the link to your fork so that they can monitor your progress.

## Instructions

- All challenges have one or more tests that run when the `run-tests-by-opening-in-browser.html` file is opened in the browser. 

- By default, Jasmine (the testing framework) will run the tests in random order. To prevent this, click on the **Options** button on the near the top-right of the page and uncheck the _run tests in random order_ checkbox.

- Solve the challenges by writing functions in the `challenges.js` file only.  **DO NOT MODIFY ANY OTHER FILE.**

- Each code challenge requires writing a **single function** to solve.

- Be sure to name the function **exactly** as specified by the challenge.

- The default display shows only the challenges that are failing. To see an overall summary of all tests, click the "**Spec List**" link.

- After solving a challenge, be sure to check the solution(s) contained in `solutions.js`. If multiple solutions are provided, they are typically shown in increasing order of "elegance".

## Committing and Pushing your Work

- Your instructors will be checking your progress from time-to-time. As you solve the challenges, commit your work, and `$ git push origin master`. This pushes the updates to your fork.
